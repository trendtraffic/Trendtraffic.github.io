You might be wondering how your brand or business can work with influencers on Instagram as well.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Influencer marketing lets brands make their mark in reaching their target audience in a way that feels a much more profound than traditional advertising. Instead of selling directly to consumers, businesses establish relationships with influencers who carry an added advantage in selling for them. Instagram influencers share such true relationship collectively in many aspects of life with their followers. It makes us feel like we know them personally, so when an influencer we like recommends something, we listen like we would if they were a friend.
<br>
<br>For example, suppose you follow a travel blogger cause they post amazing pictures and vlog whenever they travel. They post about a shoe that let them hike for hours on the mountains Despite uncomfortable weather. In that case, you're more destined to trust the brand and the influencer's experience, causing you to purchase for your upcoming hiking. It makes sense, right.
<br><br>Instagram has 800 million active users which by default sets itself as the platform to make the most use for influencer marketing. 72% of users said they earned a fashion, beauty or style-related purchase after seeing something on the app, proving its power in the digital marketing landscape of 2020</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Finding influencers and deciding on their pay: </strong>Ideally, the first step is to brainstorm the various influencers on Instagram, who collectively share the same content genre. One influencer leads to multiple influencers by the extensive use of Instagram displaying similar profiles.  
</li><li><strong>Set a budget and management strategy: </strong>You have to create your budget. Also, be sure to factor in the time needed to plan, execute, and review your influencer program. Running a successful influencer marketing campaign is not a jack-of-all-trades type of strategy. This will involve careful monitoring and follow-up. 
</li><li><strong>Decide on goals and message: </strong>Your plan and message surprisingly share the same importance. Just as you don't want to hinder the influencers' creativity and individuality, you also don't want them to run your campaign in a misleading direction. The effort has to be put in structuring the influencer marketing and the magic message which can be held on later. 
</li><li><strong>How to contact influencers: </strong>Another round of research comes into the picture to find the apt influencers after deciding on the plan set with the network, prime goal, and influencers' kind to be targeted. Then determine how you will contact them. For micro-influencers, you can get directly in a private message on the same platform. For the more established, click around their profile, and they can list the contact information for business inquiries in their bio. They can also link to a website that denotes brand partnerships. 
</li><li><strong>Revise and refine your strategy: </strong>Even if your influencer marketing campaign is underway, you should still have predetermined dates when you will measure its progress. The next part of this guide will explain how to track your results. Not all campaigns are successful, but I hope you learn from each one.&nbsp;</li>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Recent years has seen influencer marketing criticized to a certain extent. Consumers felt misled because they didn't know that someone they were following was being paid to recommend certain products.
<br>Influencers have found transparency affected. Hashtags such as #ad and #spon have become the norm in a paid publishing caption, to distinguish sponsorship deals from "genuine" recommendations. Instagram has also created its official "Paid Partnership" tag, which sits above a post to let users know that a brand collaborates with that influencer.<br><br>While at some levels, this takes away the authenticity that has made influencer marketing successful on Instagram, influencers also feel loyal to letting their followers know that they made money from a post.
<br>Neymar was walking the football field in Nike shoes following his multi-million dollar sponsorship deal with no notices appearing on our TV screens to tell us that the boots are being marketed to us, and that suggestion would sound ridiculous.<br><br>So this is a rule for traditional advertising methods, and another for Instagram influencer marketing, and it will be interesting to see how the regulations change as space expands.</p>

</strong><br><br>Because Instagram has been around for nearly a decade and has grown increasingly influential, it benefits from a global user audience. The highest concentration of users is found in the United States, with 116 million users. Next is India with 73 million users and Brazil with 72 million users. The international user market has the potential to beat the US user base in the next few years. This means that global brands have many opportunities to market to their consumers.<br></p>

                    In conclusion, the future of marketing is right on our screens in an app that used to be a photo-sharing app and now is growing in mild measures. Influencers have found ways to produce content and expand their follower base while companies ranging from smaller ones to international ones find their success by connecting to influencers. Both the parties have benefited and will continue to overtake other means of marketing. In a nutshell, it's one of the interesting platforms to make profits and essentially a career too.</p>
